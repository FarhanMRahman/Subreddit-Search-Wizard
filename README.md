Frameworks Used: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap (UI Approach)



This is a RESTful web application built with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootsrap. It fetches data from the Reddit API in JSON formatt and places them at appropriate places.

(On a side note, I wanted to work more on the server side code. But since I have three midterms before the deadline, I couldn't manage enough time. I'll definitely try to improve the app further in the future.)
